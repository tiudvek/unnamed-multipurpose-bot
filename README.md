# unnamed-multipurpose-bot
An unnamed multipurpose discord bot I want to actually work on

## JSON File
To run the bot, make a file called `config.json` in `./src/core/` (Fuck you Windows users) with the following contents
```json
{
    "bot": {
        "token": "YOUR BOT TOKEN",
        "test_guilds": ["IDS OF THE SERVERS TO PUSH SLASH COMMANDS TO, IN INTEGERS"]
    }
}
```
